* strace feature:

** still need to insert some argument/retval format strings in some
dispatch_*.c files

** maybe truncate lengths of strings (like Unix strace)

** should be able to print char arrays (i.e. not null terminated) as strings

* GEMDOS:

** Pexec:

*** implement more Pexec modes

*** parse command line given in call args, and split them in such a way
that the child emulator concatentes 'em again yielding the same result

*** which emulator args should be passed to a child emulator?

* BIOS:

** integrate vt52 emu (linking with ncurses causes SIGBUS)

** make usage of terminfo more efficient (request infos only once)

** write some kind of "scancode generator", to be able to return
ASCII+scancode to the TOS program

** Maybe once emulate Rwabs() & Co. for floppy devices
